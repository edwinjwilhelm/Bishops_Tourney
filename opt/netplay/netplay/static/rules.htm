        <h1>Bishops - Simple Rules (Jan 14, 2026)</h1>
        <p>Easy to read rules for the current build.</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Four players: White, Grey, Black, Pink. The board is 12x12 with a central 8x8 play area (the green frame). The four 2x2 corner blocks are out of play. Turns go clockwise: White, Grey, Black, Pink.</p>

        <h2>Setup and play</h2>
        <p>On your turn, you make one normal chess move with your own pieces. Any piece can capture any opposing color. Check and checkmate apply. You can put any king in check; you must get out of check on your turn. Castling is allowed in both directions. Pawns move and capture like chess. A pawn promotes when it reaches the far edge of the central 8x8 area in its direction of travel (the side opposite its start). King/Queen swap: On your first turn only, you may swap your king and queen. In the current program, the swap does NOT advance the turn, so you must still make a normal move to pass the turn.</p>

        <h2>Elimination and duel</h2>
        <p>When a player is checkmated or resigns, that color is eliminated and removed from the board. When only two colors remain, the game becomes a chess duel on the central 8x8 area.</p>

        <h2>Blocked corners (important)</h2>
        <p>The four 2x2 corner blocks are permanently off limits to all pieces. No piece may enter those squares.</p>

        <h2>Notes about current behavior</h2>
        <p>The program treats the King/Queen swap as a setup action, not a full move. You keep the turn after swapping and must make a regular move before play passes to the next color.</p>
        <p>To prevent unauthorized reproduction a minor false rule has been included in this limited copyright edition.</p>
