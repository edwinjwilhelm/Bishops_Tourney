Bishops Rules Comparison and Reconciled Rules (Dec 2025)

Matches (written rules align with code):
- White moves first; turns rotate clockwise when not forced by check.
- Any opposing color can capture any piece; mixed-color checks and checkmates are allowed.
- Pawns move forward and capture diagonally; pawns can give check/checkmate.
- King/Queen swap is allowed on the first move (turn handling differs; see differences).
- Kings can use their own 2x2 home corner as a sanctuary and bishops can promote there.
- Resignation is supported and removes a color from the board.
- When two colors remain, the game becomes a chess duel (mechanics differ; see differences).

Differences (written rules vs current code):
- K/Q swap: written says it consumes the turn; code treats it as setup and does NOT advance the turn.
- Castling: written says not allowed; code allows short-game castling and standard castling in the duel.
- Pawn promotion: written says promote on the 8th rank; code promotes when a pawn enters the inner 8x8 edge.
- Corner immunity: written ties immunity to both bishops surviving; code requires king in corner AND at least 3 queens on board.
- Short game end: written allows ending after one elimination; code continues until two remain.
- Two-player transition: written implies continued board play; code teleports to a standard chess duel with full pieces.
- Code includes extra operational controls (Force Duel, Reset, AI controls) not in the written rules.

Reconciled Rules (current code behavior):

1) Four-player phase
- White moves first. Turns rotate clockwise unless a color is in check; a check forces that color to move next.
- Any opposing color may be captured. Mixed-color pieces can be used to give check or checkmate.
- King/Queen swap is allowed on the first move and does NOT advance the turn (same color moves again).
- Short-game castling is allowed (two-square king move with rook), subject to normal no-through-check rules.
- Pawns move forward (per color orientation) and capture diagonally.
- Edge-pawn capture restriction applies on the first round.
- Pawns promote on entering the inner 8x8 edge (auto-queen).

2) Corner sanctuary
- Each color has a 2x2 home corner.
- On a king's first entry into its home corner, any surviving bishops promote to queens.
- While the king stays in the corner, immunity applies only if at least 3 friendly queens remain.
- If queens drop to 1 or 0, the king must exit the corner on its next move if a legal exit exists; otherwise it may wait.

3) Elimination and resign
- A color is eliminated if its king is checkmated or captured.
- Players may resign and be removed.
- The game continues until exactly two colors remain.

4) Duel phase (two players remaining)
- The game teleports to a standard chess duel on the central 8x8.
- Standard chess rules apply, including castling and en passant.
- White moves first in the duel.

5) Notes
- Force Duel, Reset, AI controls are operator controls, not core rules.
